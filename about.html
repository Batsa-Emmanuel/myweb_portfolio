    <h1>My web development journey in GCTU</h1>

    <p>
      The web developing journey hasn't been easy at all for a while now, not
      untill I got introduced to
      <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn">Freecodecamp</a> , a well
      equiped Platform to meet all your web development needs. I started coding
      on a daily basis as part of my daily routine. This practice has constant
      groomed me into an up-coming PRO Web developer. This has ever been my
      dream ever since I realized I loved IT and technology products ðŸ˜‚.. And
      now I can state emphatically that I'm living that dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      This platform has well transformative tools as well as web development is
      concerned. Through this Platform I've been able to learn a lot just few
      weeks after it was introduced to me. It creates a space for both beginners
      and pro web developers.

    <h3>THE JOURNEY IN A MONTH</h3>

    </section>

    <p>
      In about a months time, I was able to learn the HTML basics and apply the
      CSS as well. I then went ahead to learn some short cuts in HTML to speed
      up my coding. Through this practices I've been able to achieve a lot and
      very glad to be in this coding journey. A big appreciation going out to my
      lecturer for mounting a lot of pressure on us to continue coding on a
      daily basis.
